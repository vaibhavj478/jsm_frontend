          Welcome to Jaisalmer Desert Campand Safari Co. My name is Bhavesh, and I share a
          deep passion for travel that has only grown over the years. My journey
          started with an adventurous spirit and an eagerness to explore the
          world, and today, Iâ€™m excited to help others experience the magic of
          travel. One of the places closest to my heart is Jaisalmer, a city
          that embodies the golden allure of Rajasthan. Known as the "Golden
          City," Jaisalmer is a place where history comes alive in its
          magnificent forts, ancient havelis, and endless sand dunes. From the
          majestic Jaisalmer Fort, which stands tall as a UNESCO World Heritage
          Site, to the tranquil beauty of Gadisar Lake, Jaisalmer offers a
          perfect blend of adventure and culture
